# Double Diamond
This repository contains the technical documents used to build my first major
sculpture entitled Double Diamond. I have donated the intellectual property to
the Double Diamond Foundation which in turn has licensed it under the

## Required Software
* Rhino 3D
* SketchUp
* LightBurn

## What do we have here?

* Drawings: These are technical drawings for the sculpture including
            renderings of most of the components and sculpture itself.
            Some things may require clarification for use. If that is
            the case, please either figure it out and add a README.md to
            the folder, or submit an issue against this repo and I will
            take a look when possible. Drawings are in either Sketchup (.skp)
            or Rhinocerous 3D Version 6 (.3dm).
* Lists:    These will be lists of items and such required for the build.
            They may be materials lists or other.
